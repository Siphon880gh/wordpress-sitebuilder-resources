A handy reference collection of WordPress site builder resources, accessible from the sidebar. Supports Classic Editor, Gutenberg, WPBakery, and Elementor Pro.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a curated list of WordPress site builder resources directly in your sidebar.  
As an agency or freelancer, you may frequently work with multiple site builders—whether modifying existing websites, choosing a site builder plugin, or using a theme built on top of one. In these cases, having a quick refresher on each builder saves time and helps streamline your workflow.

The resources are organized to cover:
* **WordPress (general)**
* **Classic Editor**
* **Gutenberg**
* **WPBakery**
* **Elementor Pro**

Each section includes guides, references, and links to useful documentation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wordpress_sitebuilder_resources/` directory, or install directly through the WordPress plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.
3. Find the **Site Builder Resources** panel in your WordPress sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I contribute new resources? =
Yes! Please feel free to contribute links, tutorials, or documentation. Add them to the relevant section (WordPress, Classic Editor, Gutenberg, WPBakery, or Elementor Pro).
